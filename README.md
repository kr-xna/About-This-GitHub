# About This GitHub

Welcome to my GitHub profile!  

This space is a collection of my projects, code, and experiments as I develop and apply my skills in data analytics, business intelligence, and machine learning. Many of these projects were created as part of my Master's coursework, personal learning, or collaborative academic work.

## What You’ll Find Here

- **Learning projects:** Hands-on assignments and experiments where I explored new tools, techniques, and datasets.
- **Academic work:** Coursework involving real-world data and business problems, demonstrating applied skills.
- **Work-in-progress:** Some repositories reflect ongoing learning and may not follow production-level coding standards yet.

## Why This Matters

I believe in learning by doing — and sharing that journey.  
While some projects are polished and presentation-ready, others capture the process of experimenting, improving, and growing as a data professional.

If you have feedback or suggestions on any of my projects, feel free to reach out — I’m always eager to learn more.
